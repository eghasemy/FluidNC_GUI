## Customization Tips

### Pin Assignments
- **Check your board pinout** before using any recipe
- **Modify pin numbers** to match your wiring
- **Avoid pin conflicts** - the GUI will warn you

### Motor Settings
- **Steps per mm**: Depends on your mechanical setup
- **Max speeds**: Start conservative, increase gradually
- **Acceleration**: Tune for smooth movement without stalling

### Speeds and Feeds
- **Start slow**: Begin with lower speeds for testing
- **Increase gradually**: Find the limits of your machine
- **Document changes**: Keep notes on what works

3. **Submit via GitHub** - Create a pull request or issue

## Board-Specific Notes

### ESP32 Standard Boards
- **Pins 6-11**: Usually connected to flash memory (avoid)
- **Input-only pins**: 34, 35, 36, 39 (can't be outputs)
- **ADC2 pins**: May conflict with WiFi

### ESP32-S2/S3 Boards
- **Different pinout**: Check your specific board datasheet
- **More available pins**: Generally more I/O options
- **Built-in features**: Some have built-in displays or WiFi antennas

## Safety Reminders

‚ö†Ô∏è **Always verify configurations before use:**

- **Double-check pin assignments** against your board
- **Test at low speeds** initially
- **Verify emergency stop** works before operation
- **Check homing direction** to avoid crashes
