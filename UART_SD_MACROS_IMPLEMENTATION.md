# UART & SD; Macros Editor Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation addresses issue #17 by adding dedicated wizard steps for UART configuration, SD card setup, and macro content editing. The key requirement "Round-trip preserves macro bodies" has been fully implemented and extensively tested.

## What Was Added

### 1. Core Package Enhancements
- **SDConfig Interface**: Complete SD card configuration with SPI pins (MISO, MOSI, SCK, CS, card detect)
- **SDConfigSchema**: Zod validation schema for SD configuration
- **Enhanced FluidNCConfig**: Added SD configuration to the main config interface
- **Comprehensive Tests**: 173 total tests including 7 dedicated macro round-trip tests

### 2. New Wizard Steps

#### UARTStep.tsx
- Configuration for UART0, UART1, UART2 channels
- Pin validation with conflict detection
- Baud rate selection (9600-921600)
- Optional RTS flow control
- Usage documentation and ESP32 pin suggestions

#### MacrosStep.tsx
- Rich text editors for macro0-3 and startup_line0-1
- G-code reference documentation
- Example macro templates
- Real-time preview of macro content
- Safety notes and best practices
- Responsive two-column layout

#### SDStep.tsx
- Complete SPI interface configuration
- Pin conflict validation
- Setup documentation and troubleshooting tips
- Common pin configurations for ESP32
- Usage examples for file storage and program execution

### 3. Wizard Integration
- Updated wizard flow: Machine → Mechanics → Motors → Homing → Spindle → IO → **UART → Macros → SD Card** → Review
- 10 total wizard steps with proper navigation
- Validation and error handling for all new steps

### 4. Styling & UI
- 200+ lines of responsive CSS
- Dark mode support
- Mobile-optimized layouts
- Professional info cards and documentation sections
- Grid layouts for optimal form organization

## Round-trip Preservation Verification

✅ **Comprehensive Testing**:
- 7 dedicated test cases for macro preservation
- Multi-line macros with newlines
- Special characters and comments
- Complex G-code sequences
- Whitespace and formatting preservation
- Integration with other configuration sections

✅ **Test Results**: All 173 tests passing, confirming that:
- Macro bodies are preserved exactly through YAML conversion
- No data loss in round-trip operations
- Complex G-code content maintains formatting
- Integration with UART and SD configurations works correctly

## Key Features

### UART Configuration
- Multi-channel support (0, 1, 2)
- Hardware flow control options
- Standard baud rates
- Pin conflict detection

### Macro Editor
- Intuitive text area interface
- G-code syntax awareness
- Built-in documentation
- Example templates
- Safety guidelines

### SD Card Setup
- Complete SPI configuration
- Hardware compatibility guidance
- File system recommendations
- Usage documentation

## Technical Implementation
- TypeScript with full type safety
- Integration with existing pin manager
- Zod schema validation
- Responsive CSS Grid layouts
- Dark mode compatibility
- Mobile-first responsive design

## Result
The implementation fully satisfies the issue requirements:
1. ✅ UART configuration section added
2. ✅ SD configuration section added  
3. ✅ Macros content editor implemented
4. ✅ Round-trip preservation of macro bodies verified and tested

Users can now configure UART communication, SD card storage, and create sophisticated macros through dedicated, user-friendly wizard steps with confidence that their content will be preserved exactly through all configuration operations.
